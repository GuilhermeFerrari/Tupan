Welcome to **tupan**'s documentation!
=====================================

**tupan** is a toolbox for Astrophysical N-Body Simulations. This guide is
intended as an introductory overview of **tupan** and explains how to install
and make use of its most important features. Those who want to contribute to
the development of **tupan** might also take a look at the API documentation.

.. warning::

    This is still a work in progress; some of the material is not fully
    organized, and several aspects of **tupan** are not yet covered in
    sufficient detail. We are continually working to improve the code as
    well as the documentation and encourage interested parties to contribute.
    For information on how to do so, please send me an email at gg dot
    ferrari at gmail dot com.
