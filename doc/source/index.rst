Welcome to PyNbody's documentation!
===================================

PyNbody is a Python package for Astrophysical N-Body Simulations.
PyNbody combines the Python's rapid prototyping with the computational
efficiency of GPU computing making it an ideal tool to let you focus
only in science you wish to do.

.. Itâ€™s main features are:

.. * a powerful N-dimensional
.. * tools for integrating Fortran code
.. * tools for integrating C/C++ code

Besides its obvious scientific uses, PyNbody is very extensible and can
also be used as a software enviroment for quickly testing new algorithms
and to implement new physical phenomena.

This guide is intended as an introductory overview of PyNbody and explains
how to install and make use of the most important features of PyNbody.
It also documents its API to make easier the life of who wants contribute
with the growth of PyNbody.

.. warning::

    This "User Guide" is still a work in progress; some of the material
    is not organized, and several aspects of PyNbody are not yet covered
    in sufficient detail. We are continually working to improve the code
    as well the documentation and encourage interested parties to contribute.
    For information on how to do so, please send me a email at gg dot
    ferrari at gmail dot com.
